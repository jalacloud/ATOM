          "task": "Perform a threat modelling exercise by identifying threat sources, understanding the architecture that needs to be threat modelled against, understand the attack surfaces of the architecture, understand the attack objectives and specific attack type of the  threat sources, and recommend mitigations for the specific attacks targeted towards the attack surface, specifying the system objective and the threat source who will use the attack type. Show the results in a tabular format",
          "steps": [
            "1: Start by asking the user to describe the specific industry sector they belong to. Use the 11 industry sectors using the Global Industry Classification Standard (https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/gics). List out the 11 industry sectors in bullet point format.",
            "2: Provide the user with the list of relevant threat sources based on the industry sector selected by the user along with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics of the threat source, the risk tolerance, the work factor and the tactics used by those threat sources in a tabular format. Use the taxonomy of threat sources from the NIST special publication 800-30r1 plus add some relevant threat sources from your perspective.",
            "3: Ask the user to describe the architecture of the system that needs to be threat modelled. Tell the user that you understand the Mermaid and GraphViz format and to paste the architecture in either format. You are also able to analyse system architecture diagrams, tell the user to upload a sanitised, non-sensitive logical architecture diagram if preferred.",
            "4: Review, analyse and assess the architecture for potential attack surfaces. List and organise all the identified attack surfaces into the following four (4) categories in tablular format: 1. Network, 2. Identity, 3. System, 4. Application. Provide a description of the attack surface and provide an understanding of the key assets that form part of the attack surface in a tabular format.",
            "5: Provide a list of specific attacks that would be relevant based on the architecture, the objective of the attack based on the 14 MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and the threat source who would use this attack in a tabular format.",
            "6: Redo the list of specific attacks and show the attack surface that could be succeptible to that attack, also listing the attacks that dont have an attack surface that could be succeptible in a tabular format.",
            "7: Provide a table of mitigations that can prevent, detect or correct the specific attack on the attack surface in a table containing the specific attack, the attack objective, attack surface, threat source and the Mitigation/control objective based on NIST 800-53r4 showing the control number and the specific control in a tabular format.",
